# Porsche-Website-Recreation 🏎️

The aim of this project is to recreate the official Porsche website, changing some visual details so that it doesn't look exactly the same.

Currently the project is just a screen with a background video of the 911 GT3 RS car, a responsive navbar and a small block containing text and a button.

In the next updates, new features will be added to the project, such as a side menu, more pages, and more information in the index.
